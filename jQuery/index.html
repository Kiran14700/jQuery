    The complex's tower on Lafayette Avenue
    The American Bank Note Company Printing Plant is a repurposed complex 
    of three interconnected buildings in the Hunts Point neighborhood of 
    the Bronx in New York City. The innovative Kirby, Petit & Green design 
    was built in 1909â€“1911 by the American Bank Note Company on land which
     had previously been part of Edward G. Faile's country estate. A wide 
     variety of financial instruments were printed there; at one point, 
     over five million documents were produced per day, including half the
      securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Although the plant 
      printed currency for many countries around the world, it was best known 
      for producing Latin American banknotes, which led to it being the target of a 
      FALN terrorist bombing in 1977. The facility was used by American Bank Note 
      until about 1984, after which it was sold, redeveloped as commercial space,
       subdivided, and designated a New York City landmark. 
    Major tenants include a charter school and the New York City
